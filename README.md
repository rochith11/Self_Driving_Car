# Project: Autonomous Driving from Scratch using JavaScript
🔥Introduction
This repository explores the core mechanics of self-driving cars. It's built entirely with vanilla JavaScript. It uses no external libraries or frameworks. It demonstrates the power of fundamental programming principles in creating an autonomous vehicle simulation.

❓The "Why" of No Packages

JavaScript Journeys is a deliberate choice to uncover the inner workings of self-driving technology. 
By removing dependencies, you can gain a deeper understanding of the algorithms, control systems, and decision-making processes that drive autonomous vehicles.

✨Features

✴️Pure JavaScript Implementation: Every line of code is meticulously crafted in vanilla JavaScript, providing an insightful look into the underlying mechanisms.

✴️Neural Network for Driving Logic: A custom-built neural network forms the "brain" of the self-driving car. It demonstrates how basic AI can be implemented to interpret sensor data and navigate the road.

✴️Genetic Algorithm for Optimization: A genetic algorithm fine-tunes the neural network's parameters. This enables the car to learn and improve its driving decisions over time through evolutionary computation.

✴️Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance: The car dynamically reacts to and avoids obstacles in real time. This showcases the interplay between sensor input and decision-making logic.
